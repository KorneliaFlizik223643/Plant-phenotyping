# Block B - Artificial Intelligence Scientist - Computer Vision & Robotics

Welcome to Block B, where you'll delve into the dynamic intersection of perceiving and interacting with the world through machines. You'll learn traditional computer vision methods, deep learning models for object detection and image segmentation, and reinforcement learning for robotic control. This block is designed to provide you with a practical understanding of implementing these techniques to solve real-world challenges, preparing you to use these skills in the field.

# Creative Brief
The Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre (NPEC) is your client in this block. They approached you with a challenging problem that requires segmenting plant roots from images and controlling a liquid handling robot for inoculating plants in precise locations. Before diving into the project's technical details, understanding the basics of plant biology is vital for successfully completing the project.

Plants are essential to our future as our food directly and indirectly comes from them. NPEC aims to harness the potential of plants to meet future food and material needs without harming our planet by relying on their state-of-the-art plant phenotyping facilities.

Plant phenotyping is the process of studying and measuring plants' observable characteristics (phenotypes) that result from their genetics' interaction with the environment. These characteristics can be morphological, physiological, or biochemical. For example, the height of a corn plant is a phenotype that can be influenced by both its genetic makeup and environmental factors such as soil quality and sunlight.

NPEC offers high throughput and high-resolution data from plants both above and below ground. They have 7 different modules that allow collecting data in macro and micro dimensions with controlled environments.

This project focuses on the second module, Plant-Microbe Interaction Phenotyping, which consists of two independent phenotyping installations designed for high-throughput phenotyping of the plant shoot (Helios) and in-vitro root system (Hades). You will be working on a dataset coming from the Hades system.

Hades allows the characterization of in-vitro root systems. Up to 10,000 seedlings on more than 2000 Petri dishes can be automatically processed, including fully automated filling Petri dishes, sowing and vernalization of seeds, and growing plants in controlled environmental conditions. Moreover, it allows the automatic treatment of roots with microbes or synthetic communities. This system will enable non-destructive and automated close-range assessment of plants' functional dynamics using VNIR hyperspectral imaging, quantitative descriptions of root system architectures, and the localization and quantification of fluorescent proteins expressed by plant roots or by root-associated microorganisms. Hades also provides black and white morphometric imaging.

The dataset you will be working on contains images of Arabidopsis thaliana grown in Petri dishes. Initially, five seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana are sown in each dish and photographed daily. As days go by, seeds germinate, revealing roots, hypocotyl, and leaves. Eventually, smaller lateral roots sprout from the primary (also called main) root, and over time, these roots begin to crisscross.
