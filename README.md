# Plant Phenotyping Project

## Overview

The Plant Phenotyping Project is an AI-driven initiative designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of plant phenotyping through advanced image analysis and robotic automation. This project, undertaken for the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre (NPEC), focuses on two primary objectives: segmenting plant roots from images and automating precise plant inoculation using a liquid handling robot.

## Project Components

### 1. Root Segmentation

- **Objective**: Accurately segment plant roots from images to facilitate detailed phenotyping.
- **Method**: 
  - Leverage advanced image processing and machine learning techniques.
  - Develop models capable of identifying and delineating root structures with high precision.
- **Outcome**: Improved accuracy in root phenotyping, enabling better analysis of plant growth and health.

### 2. Robot-Controlled Inoculation

- **Objective**: Automate the inoculation process to precisely deliver substances to specific plant locations.
- **Method**:
  - Design and implement a control system for a liquid handling robot.
  - Ensure precise and consistent delivery of inoculants, reducing manual intervention and increasing experimental throughput.
- **Outcome**: Enhanced efficiency and reliability in experimental treatments, contributing to more consistent and scalable research results.
